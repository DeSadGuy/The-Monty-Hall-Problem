# description 
The Monty Hall problem is a probability puzzle named after the host of the game show "Let's Make a Deal," Monty Hall. The problem goes as follows:

You are a contestant on a game show. There are three doors in front of you. Behind one door is a car, and behind the other two doors are goats. Your goal is to choose the door with the car behind it.

Here's how the game works:

You choose one of the three doors.
After you make your choice, the host, Monty Hall, who knows what's behind each door, opens one of the other two doors to reveal a goat.
Now, you have a choice to make. You can either stick with your original choice or switch to the remaining unopened door.
Finally, the host asks you to make your final decision, and the door you choose is opened.
The question is: Should you stick with your original choice or switch to the other unopened door to maximize your chances of winning the car?

The answer may surprise you!

# Conclusion 
The Monty Hall problem is a probability puzzle that has a counterintuitive solution. The best strategy is to always switch doors after the host reveals a goat behind one of the other two doors. By switching doors, you increase your chances of winning the car from 1/3 to 2/3. This is because the host's decision to reveal a goat provides you with additional information that you can use to your advantage.
